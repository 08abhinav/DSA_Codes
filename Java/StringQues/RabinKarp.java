/* Rabin-Karp Algorithm
 * This string-searching algorithm is used to find a pattern in a text.
 * It is done using hashing for eg-> we have to find a pattern(P) in text(T), so we will calculate the hashP and then compare it
 with the hash value of substring in text(T) if matches return else continue.
    Pros
    -> Efficient for multiple pattern searching.
    -> Rolling hash avoids recomputation.

    Cons
    -> Hash collisions can cause false positives â†’ needs verification.
    
    Real World use case:
    -> Plagiarism detection
    -> Searching DNA sequences
