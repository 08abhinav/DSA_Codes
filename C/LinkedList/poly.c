/* Polynomial execution using linked list
eg- given to us 2x^3+5x^2+7x+10
so we have to solve this polynomial equation using linked list

***IMPORTANT POINTS:
-> if exponent is greater than the existing exponent it should
be before the smallest exponent

-> if exponent is smaller thant the existing exponent then it 
should be after the greater exponent

-> if exponent already exist and user insert the same exponent
it should not inserted in list

-> there should be three function 1.Insert 2.Display 3.Evaluate
